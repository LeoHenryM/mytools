In case of corruption:

Here’s a step-by-step guide to resolve this:

Restart R Session: Before proceeding with any changes, it's a good idea to restart your R session to clear any existing processes and release locked files.


Remove the problematic package:
If the package mytools is the one causing the issue, you should first try to remove it. You can do this from R with the following command:

remove.packages("mytools")

After removing the package, you should also manually check the library location (/Users/leohenry/Library/R/x86_64/4.2/library/) and make sure there are no remaining files from mytools. If there are, delete them manually.


Reinstall the package:
If you have the package source or script used to create it, you can reinstall it. If you’re using devtools to install it directly from source, you can run:

devtools::install_local("/Users/leohenry/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personnel/Documents/Cours/Projets/R-Packages/mytools_xxx.tar.gz")
install.packages("/Users/leohenry/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personnel/Documents/Cours/Projets/R-Packages/mytools_xxx.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")


Make sure you replace "/path/to/your/package" with the actual path where your package source files are located.
Test the installation:

After reinstalling, load the package using library(mytools) and check if the issue persists.


Optional - Building the package:
If you’re developing your own package and want to make sure it’s set up correctly, consider using devtools::check() to validate everything. Although you mentioned not needing something fancy, this can help catch issues early.
For a simpler check, use:
R
Copy code
devtools::load_all("/path/to/your/package")
This loads all functions without actually installing the package, useful for quick testing during development.
These steps should help fix the corrupt database issue and get your package running smoothly. If the problem continues, you may need to investigate further into possible issues with your R installation or even filesystem errors that could be affecting file integrity.
